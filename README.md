### About me
👋 Hey! I’m Alex — a Senior Software Engineer with long experience designing and building scalable backend systems.  

💻 I’ve worked on products at **New Relic**, **Hotels.com**, and **Ocado Technology**, focusing on reliability, observability, and clean architecture.

🧠 My core expertise is in **Java**, **distributed systems**, and **cloud infrastructure**, and I’m currently diving deeper into **Go**, **Python**, and **Node.js** — exploring how **AI** and **LLMs** can make software development smarter and faster.

🚀 Curious by nature, I love turning ideas into maintainable, scalable systems that deliver real value.
